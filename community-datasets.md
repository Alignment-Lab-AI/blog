# Data is better together: Enabling communities to collectively build better datasets together using Argilla and Hugging Face Spaces 

Recently Argilla and Hugging Face [launched](https://huggingface.co/posts/dvilasuero/680660181190026) `Data is Better Together`, an experiment to collectively build a preference dataset of prompt rankings. In a few weeks we've had:

- Over 346 people contributed rankings 
- Over 11,000 prompt ratings

See the [progress dashboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DIBT/prompt-collective-dashboard) for the latest stats!

This resulted in the release of `10k-prompts-rated`, a dataset consisting of 10,000 prompts with preference rankings for the quality of the prompt. We want to enable many more projects like this!

In this post, we’ll discuss why we think it’s essential for the community to collaborate on building datasets and share an invitation to join the first cohort of communities [Argilla](https://argilla.io/) and Hugging Face will support to develop better datasets together! 

## Why build datasets collectively?

Data continues to be essential for better models: We see continued evidence from [published research](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.05123) , open-source [experiments](https://argilla.io/blog/notus7b/), and from the open-source community that better data can lead to better models.

Data is vital for machine learning, but many languages, domains and tasks still lack high-quality datasets for training, evaluating and benchmarking — the community already shares 100s of models, datasets and demos via the Hugging Face Hub every day.  As a result of collaboration, the open-access AI community has created amazing things. Enabling the community to build datasets collectively will unlock amazing opportunities for building the next generation of datasets to build the next generation of models. 

Empowering the community to build and improve datasets collectively will allow people to:

- Create chat datasets for a particular language
- Develop benchmark datasets for a specific domain 
- Create preference datasets from a diverse range of participants 
- Build datasets for a particular task 
- Build completely new types of datasets collectively as a community 

### Making it easy for people to contribute 

One of the challenges to many previous efforts to build AI datasets collectively was setting up an efficient annotation task. Argilla is an open-source tool that can help create datasets for LLMs and smaller specialised task-specific models. Hugging Face Spaces is a platform for building and hosting machine learning demos and applications. Recently, Argilla added support for authentication via a Hugging Face account for Argilla instances hosted on Spaces. This means it now takes seconds for users to start contributing to an annotation task.

Now that we have stress-tested this new workflow when creating the `10k_prompt_rankings` dataset, we want to support the community in launching new collective dataset efforts. 

## Join our first cohort of communities who want to build better datasets together!

We’re very excited about the possibilities unlocked by this new simple flow for hosting annotation tasks. To support the community in building better datasets Hugging Face and Argilla invite interested people and communities to join our initial cohort of community dataset builders. 

People joining this cohort will:

- Be supported in creating an Argilla Space with Hugging Face authentication. Hugging Face will grant free persistent storage and improved CPU spaces for participants. 
- Have their comms and promotion advertising the initiative amplified by Argilla and Hugging Face.
= Be invited to join a cohort community channel 

Our goal is to support the community in building better datasets together. We are open to many ideas and want to support the community as far as possible in building better datasets together.

## What tasks are we looking to support?

We are open to many ideas and want to support the community as far as possible. Tasks could include building chat datasets for a particular language, validating the translation of an existing dataset, creating new preference data, or building a dataset for a specific domain. 

Tasks can either be fully open or open to members of a particular organisation. 

If you want to be part of the first cohort, please get in touch here.
